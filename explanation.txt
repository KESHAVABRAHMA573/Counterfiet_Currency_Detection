1. Importing Required Libraries:

This block imports all necessary Python libraries for building and training the deep learning model.
ResNet50 is a pre-trained model that will be used as a base for transfer learning.
ImageDataGenerator helps in preprocessing and augmenting image datasets.
Dense, Flatten, Dropout are layers used to modify the model architecture.
ModelCheckpoint and EarlyStopping are used to save the best model and stop training early if accuracy doesn't improve.
matplotlib and seaborn are used for visualization.
confusion_matrix helps in evaluating the model's performance.

2. Defining Image Dimensions:

This block sets the dimensions for input images.
The model will resize all images to 300x300 pixels before training.

3. Loading Pretrained ResNet50 Model:

This block loads the ResNet50 model pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset.
include_top=False removes the fully connected layers so that we can add our custom classification layers.
input_shape=(height, width, 3) specifies the input image size with 3 color channels (RGB).

4. Defining Dataset Directories:

Specifies the directory paths for training, validation, and testing images.
These directories should contain subfolders representing different classes (e.g., "Real" and "Fake").

5. Defining Batch Size:

Defines the number of images that will be processed at a time during training.
Smaller batch sizes use less memory, but larger batch sizes improve model stability.

6. Creating Data Generators with Augmentation:

Creates an ImageDataGenerator instance to preprocess and augment images before feeding them to the model.
preprocess_input: Normalizes images for ResNet50.
rotation_range=90: Randomly rotates images up to 90 degrees.
width_shift_range and height_shift_range: Moves the image randomly along X and Y axes.
shear_range=0.2: Applies shearing transformations.
zoom_range=0.2: Zooms in or out on images randomly.
horizontal_flip=True: Flips images horizontally to increase variability.
fill_mode='nearest': Fills missing pixels after transformation.
flow_from_directory: Loads images from the train_dir and applies augmentation.

7. Creating Validation Data Generator:

Creates a validation data generator without augmentation.
Only applies preprocess_input to normalize images.
flow_from_directory loads validation images from validation_dir.

8. Function to Check Dataset Structure:

This function checks if dataset folders (Training, Validation, Testing) exist.
It also verifies whether "Real" and "Fake" image classes exist inside these folders.
Returns a dictionary with image counts or error messages.

9. Building Fine-tuned ResNet50 Model:

Builds a custom classification head on top of the pre-trained ResNet50 model.
Freezes the pre-trained layers so they don't change during training.
Adds:
Flatten(): Converts feature maps into a single vector.
Fully connected (Dense) layers with ReLU activation.
Dropout to prevent overfitting.
Output layer with softmax activation for multi-class classification.

10. Defining Model Parameters:

Defines the labels for classification.
Uses two fully connected layers (1024 neurons each).
dropout=0.5 prevents overfitting.

11. Training the Model:

Trains the model using train_generator.
Runs for num_epochs epochs.
Uses validation data to check accuracy.
Includes checkpoint to save the best model and early_stopping to stop training if accuracy stops improving.

12. Evaluating the Model:

Runs model evaluation using a confusion matrix.
evaluate_model() function computes predictions and compares them with actual labels.
